Installing the AxKit OpenOffice Provider module.
================================================

Installation is simple - follow the regular perl module installation
system:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test install

This installs the perl modules.

Please note that the installation assumes a currently working AxKit
installation. If you do not have that, please install AxKit from
http://axkit.org/ - or ask your axkit.com representative about help
getting AxKit installed.

Now to get the OpenOffice files working on your web server, you need
to add some Apache configuration options. Here is a simple example:

<Files *.sxw>
  AddHandler axkit .sxw
  AxAddPlugin Apache::AxKit::Plugin::OpenOffice
  AxContentProvider Apache::AxKit::Provider::OpenOffice
  AxAddProcessor text/xsl /stylesheets/oo2html.xsl
</Files>

Now simply copy the stylesheets directory to the root of your web
server's filesystem (normally /path/to/apache/htdocs) such that
you could point your browser at 
http://myserver/stylesheets/oo2html.xsl, and get that particular
file (if that does not work, then the OpenOffice plugin will not
do what you expect).

Having done all of that, you are ready to start serving OpenOffice
files direct to your browser. Simply save them within the document
root somewhere, and point your browser at them.

If any of this fails, or you get stuck, please contact a representative
of axkit.com, who will be glad to help you.
