Catalog Support
===============

If you experience problems with the OpenOffice files trying to
open non-existant DTD files, then copy the contents of the dtds
directory to /usr/share/xml/openofficeorg and make sure that the 
nobody or apache user can read those files. Then add the following
to /etc/xml/catalog (or copy dtds/rootcatalog to /etc/xml/catalog
if you don't already have a catalog file there):

  <delegatePublic publicIdStartString="-//OpenOffice.org//" 
        catalog="file:///usr/share/xml/openofficeorg/catalog.xml"/>

After that, DTDs should "just work". If they do not, please contact
an AxKit support representative.
